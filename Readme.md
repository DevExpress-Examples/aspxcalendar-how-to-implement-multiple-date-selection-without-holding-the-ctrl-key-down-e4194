# ASPxCalendar - How to implement multiple date selection without holding the CTRL Key down 


<p>This sample illustrates how to select several dates in ASPxCalendar without pressing Ctrl or Shift buttons. The main idea is to override the ASPxCalendar </p><p>OnDayMouseDown client function and pass info to this function that the Ctrl button is pressed. Pass true as the third parameter of the OnDayMouseDown function. </p>
